      <p><strong>Special-Force Unit:</strong> Dire Talon</p>
      <p><strong>Mission Brief:</strong> Quadfall: simultaneous denial. Targets — Relay Point G, Cinder Depot, Barracks Nine, Vault-Cache Delta. Alpha Lead coordinates windows. Each company breaks seal, completes assigned denial or capture objective, and extracts on pre-set vector. No cross-talk. Fail one, fail all. Execute.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Op Start — Four Blades Out</h2>
        <p>At 0200 the battalion blooms from shadow — twelve stealth dropships carving four parallel insertion corridors. Each company rides two dropships: one direct insertion (team), one perimeter/watch (reserve + ISR). Gunships orbit in tiered cover; micro-UAVs fan ahead like locusts to map patrol loops.</p>
        <p><strong>Talon-Red</strong> (seize comms) lands at Relay Point G — a rooftop cluster of glass ribs on a sleep-tight orbit antenna.</p>
        <p><strong>Talon-Black</strong> (deny fuel) slides into Cinder Depot — a corrugated hangar of drums and makeshift pipelines.</p>
        <p><strong>Talon-Sable</strong> (capture officer cadre) ghosts into Barracks Nine — a fortified linear compound.</p>
        <p><strong>Talon-White</strong> (neutralize weapons cache) slips into Vault-Cache Delta — a subterranean ammo depot under a salvage yard.</p>
        <p>They all insert within the same thirty-second window. Above them, gunships and dropships climb out and circle. The battalion fractures into four distinct hunts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Phase One — Micro Battles, Macro Timer</h2>
        <p>Each company moves like a scaled echo of the others: breachers slide, sniper pairs perch, riflers flow.</p>
        <p>Talon-Red’s snipers take the antennas while breachers ghost internal access. ISR ghosts loop feed to gunships so targeted EMP pulses can be timed to silence the relay as the team slips the core out.</p>
        <p>Talon-Black rigs soft charges under fuel manifolds and reroutes vent lines into safe dumps while isolating the yard with trip nets and micromines. Attack drones mark remote igniters as tertiary denial.</p>
        <p>Talon-Sable infiltrates the barracks’ mess hall, isolating lieutenants in muted takedowns. They prize two officers for capture — nodes of intel — while sniper pairs watch the perimeter.</p>
        <p>Talon-White goes low, sealing a shaft and moving through maintenance tunnels. They set charges on ammo pallets and extract data modules that identify cache hierarchies.</p>
        <p>Each team has a ten-minute hard window before pre-set ECM and sensor loops expire. Synchronization is Kael’s art: he pips the clocks with microsecond ticks and lets each blade sing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Complication — The Echoes Collide</h2>
        <p>Halfway through the clocks, a stray contractor truck — delayed route — rumbles into the salvage yard above Vault-Cache Delta. Its headlights sweep a Talon-White sniper pair. The pair disable the driver but the engine stalls loudly. An alarm ping whistles through the local net.</p>
        <p>The ping ripples. Relay Point G’s automated watchdogs flick to high permission and begin a diagnostic sweep. Talon-Red’s breacher sees a sweep arc across their corridor. Kael’s field net tightens: “Breach echo — abort pattern B if compromised. Go contingency X.”</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, a fuel drum at Cinder Depot registers an unusual pressure spike from yesterday’s repair job — Talon-Black’s soft charges show as micro-pressure variations, and one sensor trips an internal alarm. Now three sites are beginning to breathe firelights.</p>
        <p>Kael orders triage: the priority becomes recovery of captured officers and ensuring the relay data gets off-world. He fragments timing: Red must compress extraction by two minutes; White must seal the truck problem and move; Black must detonate cleanly in a stagger to avoid lighting Sable’s barracks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Phase Two — Controlled Noise</h2>
        <p>The battalion folds contingency into execution with brutal precision.</p>
        <p>Talon-White’s breachers execute a silent fuel-shut on the contractor truck, spiking coolant lines to stall the engine entirely. Attack drones smash the radio array so no distress beacon sails. The team packs the driver into a lined bag — alive — and trusts him to be an evidence node.</p>
        <p>Talon-Black staggers their charges in a ring that channels blasts outward and vent lines inward; the depot burns but does not detonate or cascade. The controlled fire masks noises from Barracks Nine as thermal clouds rise.</p>
        <p>Talon-Sable moves faster; the captured lieutenants are hustled into low-signature extraction alcoves. A firefight sees two sentries downed; a third is taken alive for interrogation. They slip through a wall of smoke and meet a waiting micro-UAV corridor that paints the egress road.</p>
        <p>Talon-Red, last to leave, corners the relay’s core. Their breacher wrenches the torus out of its mount; a sniper pair collapses the relay’s pointing array with hairline rounds timed to create a false system fault. The core is sealed; detritus is left to look like technical failure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Exfil — Four Shadows Back</h2>
        <p>At staggered intervals, each company vanishes under the same night sky. Dropships, which had not lingered, stitch a return corridor; gunships white-line the horizon and pick off any pursuit. Micro-UAVs spray decoy heat signatures into the valley so sensors read four full companies retreating along false vectors.</p>
        <p>Talon-Red slips a micro-data core into a sealed canister and climbs aboard a stealth dropship first. Talon-Black’s structured burn buys them a ten-minute window as their charges go off in a designed sequence. Talon-Sable explodes a decoy cache, leaving the enemy to sift through rubble and false leads. Talon-White radios last sweep: “All accounted. Truck disabled. Driver in custody.”</p>
        <p>They fold into the black like talons retracting. Above, Kael hears the soft chorus of status pips: all green, some amber, no reds. He lets himself a breath.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Aftermath & Hook</h2>
        <p>Back aboard the cutter Kael watches the cores and captured officers processed. The relay core hums with partial network traces — links to a proto-sleeper cell. The officers bleed info fast and messy; they spit names of brokers and shell companies. The depot’s feed reveals a clandestine fuel line selling off to private militias.</p>
        <p>Quadfall is logged as a success: four objectives met, one officer for prosecution, several leads for the Directorate. But the salvaged relay core contains an encrypted handshake that traces its origin to a flagged corporate contractor with diplomatic cover.</p>
        <p>Kael files the report. Quadfall bought time, but the decrypted handshake will point them at a new and quieter enemy. The talons sheathed — for now.</p>
