      <p><strong>Special-Force Unit:</strong> Dire Talon</p>
      <p><strong>Mission Brief:</strong> Shardstorm: converge on my mark. Red — rooftop. Black — main gate breach. Sable — tunnels. White — flanking sniper and rapid assault. We punch five holes in their seals at T-zero. Core live extraction. No purge. Gunships set suppression windows. Drones to sink automated safeties. Timing is life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Op Start — Four Axes, One Heartbeat</h2>
        <p>The Shard sits in a cratered field, ringed by external sensors and tethered armored nodes. Dozens of patrol bots and automated turrets watch the approaches. The battalion rehearses in silence; dropships bloom to assigned vectors.</p>
        <p><strong>Talon-Red</strong> strikes high: three stealth dropships set on the rooftop to take the observation gantries and deploy breachers through collapsed skylights. Sniper pairs target turret housings.</p>
        <p><strong>Talon-Black</strong> slams the main gate: breachers, shock teams, and shielded riflers make a frontal assault to pin defenses and pull fire away from the core.</p>
        <p><strong>Talon-Sable</strong> tunnels: they enter from maintenance shafts mapped months earlier, moving under the facility to breach the core chamber’s underfloor, cutting purge lines.</p>
        <p><strong>Talon-White</strong> holds the flank: long-range marksmen and attack drone controllers deliver overwatch and mobile suppression as Red and Black advance.</p>
        <p>All four threads hit within a single synchronized countdown. Gunships hold above on staggered windows of suppression; ISR micro-UAV webs paint moving blues across the facility so each team sees the others’ lanes in real time.</p>

        <h2>Phase One — Simultaneous Penetration</h2>
        <p>At T-zero, Talon-Red shatters the rooftop control deck. Snipers pop turret controllers; breachers rip an upper maintenance hatch and deploy charges into the central ventilation stack to create an access funnel.</p>
        <p>Talon-Black detonates a shaped breach at the main gate; shock teams flood the outer yard and draw automated units into kill-zones. Black’s suppression creates a corridor for Red teams to push inward from above.</p>
        <p>Talon-Sable’s subsurface teams rupture into the lower service ring and begin cutting purge lines, clamping fallback valves and splicing emergency thresholds. Their movement is invisible to above-ground sensors, and their timing is crucial: if they fail to cut purge, the facility will flush the core.</p>
        <p>Talon-White lays out a ring of lethal overwatch. High-caliber marksmen reduce drone nests and cover the teams’ lateral moves; their attack drone controllers send two drones to jam the automation grid for exactly ninety seconds — enough for the teams to move but not long enough to alert orbital monitors.</p>

        <h2>Complication — The Scuttle Sequence</h2>
        <p>Halfway to the core, the facility’s AI triggers a scuttle protocol: micro-detonators begin locking primary valves into purge. The AI has a three-minute fail safe: purge in 180 seconds unless a specific multi-vector key is delivered.</p>
        <p>Kael’s voice is a razor: “Sable, you have 120. Black, speed up breach two minutes. Red, suppress. White, extension on drone jammer — now.” The net becomes an instrument of breath — everyone’s timing must be perfect.</p>
        <p>Sable races through conduits: technicians plant seizure clamps while snipers above take out turret control matrices. Black’s shock teams punch a second breach to shorten the transit lane; Red threads a maintenance ladder into the core’s top hatch and a breacher literally pries open the chamber as the purge countdown ticks ever lower.</p>

        <h2>Phase Two — Blood & Wire</h2>
        <p>The core chamber is a cathedral of pipework and glass — the catalytic heart glows like an angry sun. The Talons converge: Red rappels in from above; Sable pushes up from below; Black floods in from the front; White corals incoming automata.</p>
        <p>Fights compress into the chamber like storms into a basin. Automated drones whirl; turrets redeploy faster than predicted. A safety trip ignites a hot line; someone screams and the line sears a boot. A sniper pair takes an optic hit and goes down — not dead, but stunned.</p>
        <p>Kael coordinates with millimeter commands: two attack drones crash into the purge valve assembly and detonate with shaped blasts, deforming casings but not rupturing the core. Sable’s engineers splice clamps onto purge conduits; Red’s breacher drives a mechanical lock that forces the core into a maintenance hold.</p>
        <p>At T-minus 30 seconds the scuttle protocol starts to tick down — 30… 20… 10… 3… and then it freezes. The lock holds. The chamber is intact. Kael breathes once into the net, then issues the extraction protocol.</p>

        <h2>Extraction — Core Live, Exit Hot</h2>
        <p>The core is secured in a lined cradle. Engineers strap diagnostic dampeners across the vessel and begin an isolation sequence. Black fights a rearguard while Red and Sable pull out through narrow corridors. White’s drones lay a scorched path for exfil.</p>
        <p>The battalion’s vehicles — staged in hidden hollows — roar toward pre-set clamps as gunships rise to choke the sky. Tactical Vehicles punch into the breach lanes; men pile in, either bloodied or blacked with grime. Attack drones peel off to take a sacrificial arc into a pursuing armor train and blow its fuel racks in a blinding fire.</p>
        <p>They race to the transport rings where stealth dropships hover low. The transports accept the vehicles, clamps snap, and the battalion folds into the belly of the Aegis Spear with one last howl of engines.</p>

        <h2>Aftermath & Hook</h2>
        <p>The Shard is secure, the catalytic core live and humming under Kael’s watch. The battalion is exhausted, three WIA, one sniper pair missing but later recovered (one KIA). The intelligence gleaned from the Shard points to a clandestine supply chain linking the facility to a front company registered in a neutral system.</p>
        <p>Kael files the log with a dry note: “Shardstorm successful. Core secured. Data flags two corporate shell arteries. Recommend Directorate escalation.”</p>
        <p>But as the Aegis Spear slips back into dark, Kael sees a single line in the shard’s internal ledger — an export token stamped with a location linked to a far deeper network. The strike may have won the day, but it peeled another layer off a larger conspiracy. The Talons have the core. Someone richer and quieter now knows it is gone.</p>
