      <p><strong>Special-Force Unit:</strong> Stealth Spear</p>
      <p><strong>Mission Brief:</strong> Terrorist enclave “Crimson Vow” holds a fortified canyon complex. Objective: eliminate hostile forces and capture leader Idran Vale alive. No friends left behind.</p>
      <p><strong>Final Order:</strong> “Storm in. Burn it down. Bring the leader breathing. Stormbreak is go.”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Op Start — Black Sky, Three Wedges</h2>
      <p>The Aegis Spear opens its belly. Three tactical dropships and two transport dropships cleave the atmosphere in a tight triangular wedge — engines screaming into the canyon’s mouth. Two transport dropships peel away early, angling toward a hidden plateau several kilometers from the complex. They will unload the six Tactical Vehicles there, unseen, and wait.</p>
      <p>Just before the dropships reach the canyon, Falcon’s dropship breaks off at the last second — skimming a jagged cliff that overlooks the base. It flares hard, hovers just long enough for the Falcons to disembark, then claws skyward again, vanishing into the clouds to circle above. The other two dropships — Raptor’s and Warden’s — slam down inside the canyon. Raptors slide out and split into two six-man claws; Warden fans outward to lock chokepoints. Moments later, their dropships roar back into the air, engines howling as they climb into high cover to orbit with the Falcons’ dropships. ISR micro-UAVs bloom and paint the base in wireframe.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Overwatch, Sweep & The Silent Storm</h2>
      <p>Falcon optics pick apart the complex. Thermal signatures ping: guards, sentries, patrols. The central block — hardened, corrugated, humming with power — shows Vale’s biometrics pinned in its core. Raptor slips through shadows. Left claw ghosts into the barracks: suppressed rounds and knives, charges tacked beneath fuel lines. Right claw ghosts through the power shed and turret nests, neutralizing crews and planting more charges. Warden seals natural exits with razorwire and motion mines, turning canyon mouths into funnels. The base grows quiet as the green dots on Raptor HUDs tally primed charges around the complex. Only the central command remains untouched — the last prize.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Breach & Alarm</h2>
      <p>Raptor slashes into the command block. The first corridors are cleared with clinical speed. They reach the antechamber outside Vale’s suite, breath controlled, blades at the ready. A lone guard, stumbling from a stair, catches sight of movement. He bellows an alarm. The alarm screams back from a dozen speakers — and the canyon ignites. Cain gives the call: “Now.”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Chain — Firewalk</h2>
      <p>Charges erupt in a controlled chain: prefab blocks flop like dominoes, fuel drums explode into geysers of flame, and scavenged turret banks vanish in molten showers. The canyon becomes a furnace. Hostiles pour into open ground — and Falcons, from their cliff vantage, become executioners. Micro-UAVs stream targeting grids down into the chaos. Gunships ride those grids and slice through enemy concentrations with pinpoint volleys. Warden unit turn the exits into killing fields, matrixed fields of overlapping fire that shred anyone trying to flee under the roaring sky. Inside the collapsing command block, Raptors grind through the last defenders. Shock grenades pop, the air tastes of cordite and dust. They find Vale in the innermost room: furious, defiant, shielded by a handful of die-hard followers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Close — Capture at the Eye</h2>
      <p>The firefight is raw and close. A suicide vest detonates in a doorway, injuring a Raptor badly; another operative takes shrapnel but keeps moving. Medic takes the injured Raptor to the side and bandages him. Still — Vale is subdued, stunned cuffs slamming onto his wrists. Cain hauls him down while other Raptors return fire through the smoke. Cain radios: “Package secured. Repeat: package secured. We’re moving to exfil.”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Transport Drop & The Planned Linkup</h2>
      <p>Farther up the plateau, the two Transport Dropships finish unloading the six Tactical Vehicles. Crews run diagnostics, engine coils wind up, and the vehicles idle like predators waiting for a signal. Warden sends a short pulse: vehicles deployed, hold for link. Transports crouch, blips on the plateau like sleeping whales. Down in the canyon, the complex is collapsing into flame. Raptors and Wardens converge on the rally point — a narrow wash that snakes toward the plateau. The incoming convoy’s path is cut with burning wrecks and enemy ambushes. Time is measured in heartbeats.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Falcon Rendezvous — Thrusters, Drop, Board</h2>
      <p>Falcon One’s leader snaps the order. Each Falcon operator straps on their short-burn thrusters — the mission modification that gives them one clean flight. In a ripple of white exhaust they launch down the face of the cliff. The burn is violent and brief; they streak across the canyon mouth and fall into the wash just ahead of the arriving vehicles. In the space of seconds, the Falcons slam into the sides of Tactical Vehicles, guns blazing to cover the approach, then slot aboard. Every operative is inside a vehicle before the convoy takes off — Raptors with Vale in the middle two vehicles, Warden strapping in the rear two vehicles, Falcons taking the front two vehicles. The vehicles are full, heavy with bodies and the weight of victory.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Exfil — The Six-Vehicle Run</h2>
      <p>The six Tactical Vehicles thundered forward, engines wailing, tires throwing plumes of ash. Warden’s machine guns chew at pursuing elements. From above, the six stealth gunships along with the three dropships — guided by Falcons’ updated targeting — slice pursuing pickups and gun emplacements to scrap. Attack drones launch in a screaming ballet: four dive into a packed enemy staging area and erupt, blowing a wall of dirt and metal across the convoy’s flank. The other drones peel off, shepherding the route. The canyon pushes back with a final fury — a line of technicals attempts to pin the convoy at a choke. Falcons shout coordinates into open mics. Gunships deliver a punishing strike right down the road; the technicals disintegrate in a line of flame. The convoy surges.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Linkup — The Transport Pickup</h2>
      <p>Miles up the approach, the plateau reappears as the convoy crests exposed flats. The two Transport Dropships hover, engines purring, their ramps yawning like mouths. Each transport has space for three Tactical Vehicles; the linkup is measured and practiced. Vehicles race up the ramps. Men haul Vale up into secure bays; medics attend to the wounded; Falcons keep returning fire through open hatches as clamps snap home. One vehicle grazes a berm and skids, but the vehicle's driver guns the engines and pins it into the transport bay. The last clamp catches; the final ramp seals. With everyone and every vehicle aboard, the transports pivot as one and burn the atmosphere for the Aegis Spear. Behind them, the canyon is a smoldering bruise — a mission completed, a pyre of enemy positions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Extraction & Aftermath</h2>
      <p>The transports stitch a steady climb toward orbit. The three tactical dropships — their bays sealed and guns hot — fall back into formation under the cutter along with the gunships. The Aegis Spear swallows them all into its cavernous hangar, mag-anchors locking them in place. Ramps lower. The six Tactical Vehicles roll out first, engines still ticking from the hard ride. Raptors emerge with Vale in custody, flanked by Falcons and followed by Wardens. The hangar deck hums with activity — medics rushing to the wounded, engineers swarming the vehicles, loaders moving drones back into storage. And then the crowd parts. Their Commanding Officer strides into the hangar, flanked by aides and two armored guards. He doesn’t wait on the command deck or behind a holotable — he comes to the fire-blackened operatives themselves. His eyes sweep the unit, pausing on the scorched armor and the bandaged limbs. Finally, his gaze fixes on Idran Vale, bound and sullen in Raptor’s grip. “So this,” the CO says, voice cutting through the clamor, “is the firebrand who’s been bleeding half a sector dry.” He steps closer, studying Vale with something between contempt and curiosity. Vale tries to sneer, but the cuffs and the presence of thirty-six silent operators rob him of force. The CO turns to Cain. “Stormbreak is logged as complete. Leader captured. Enemy force neutralized. Casualties minimal.” He nods once, slow. “You did well.” His tone hardens. “But Vale’s capture will not go unanswered. Crimson Vow will strike back — harder, faster. This is no ending, Commander. This is the opening shot of something worse.” Cain answers evenly: “We’ll be ready, sir.” The CO gives the barest flicker of approval, then waves for guards to haul Vale to the brig. He lingers one more moment, eyes on the unit as a whole. “Get cleaned up. Debrief in two hours. You’re still on the hunt.” He leaves as abruptly as he entered, boots ringing on alloy plating. The hangar hum resumes. Vale is dragged away, still cursing. The operatives stand among their scarred vehicles and still-warm weapons, knowing that the fire they lit today will burn beyond this canyon. They are thirty-six strong, battered but alive. And the storm is only beginning.</p>
