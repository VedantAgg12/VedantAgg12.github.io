      <p><strong>Special-Force Unit:</strong> Shadow Talon</p>
      <p><strong>Mission Brief:</strong> “High-value prototype extraction. Station: Caliban Array, orbiting Ring-9. Hostiles: private security + unidentified kinetic arrays. Time: Night-window; comms scrubbed. Insertion: low-flash, three drops — Raptor in, Falcons overwatch, Warden holds perimeter and casualty evac. Rules: in, grab the module, out. Repercussions: catastrophic if prototype remains. Move.” Call signs: Raptor (Cain), Falcon One (Iris), Falcon Two (Gale), Warden (Doc).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Op Start — The Drop</h2>
      <p>The cutter cleaves the ring’s shadow like a blade. Below, the Caliban Array is a lattice of antennae and sealed bays — one of its sunward faces burned black. The dropships bloom from the cutter’s belly in a controlled chaos: three tubes, three arcs, three brief fires that kiss plasma and vanish into the ring’s murk.</p>
      <p>Raptor’s Tactical Dropship punches the nearest maintenance pylon. Cain’s voice is calm: “Stack. Eyes hot in sixty.” Twelve silhouettes fan out into an industrial cathedral of scaffolding and sparking conduits. Falcons drift high in stealth gunships, small as predatory moths, firing ECM pulses that make the Array’s sensors hiccup. Warden’s APCs and hover-bikes take up the far flank, screening egress lanes.</p>
      <p>Micro-UAVs spool: twenty-four bees that feed thermal maps back to Raptor’s HUD. The first contact is a pair of security walkers — armatures with turreted fists. Raptor erupts: a dozen trained bodies move like a single animal, suppressed casings, silent blades, and concussive charges. The walkers go silent on impact — bone and oil.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Twist — The Prototype Isn’t What They Expected</h2>
      <p>They breach Lab-7 and find the prototype: not a weapon but a living core — a sealed bio-reactor humming with pale, gelled light. The display warns: experimental. The lab’s lead tech, alive but sedated, blinks and mouths: “Don’t—don’t let them touch it.”</p>
      <p>Before Cain can process, a preprogrammed failsafe bangs open external shutters: orbital kinetic darts begin to streak inward, setting the station aflame in razor lines. Falcon Two reports three incoming skirmishers converging from an adjacent bay. Iris orders an Aegis Canvas — a blind of drone swarms and flarechaff — while Gale pings two stealth gunships to sweep low. The gunships answer with silent missiles that carve through the station’s outer armor; the shock makes the lab lights gutter.</p>
      <p>Raptor bundles the bio-reactor into a containment cradle — weighty, humming, and strangely warm. Warden’s Doc rigs a rapid immuno-seal as he hammers diagnostics: “Containment nominal. But it’s awake. It’s listening.” Cain bites down a curse. Extraction just got complicated.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Assault — The Station Fights Back</h2>
      <p>With the extraction cradle registered, the Array’s internal defenses snap to a higher permission tier. Automated turrets bloom from ceiling housings; corridor doors slam. Attack drones — previously dormant — spin up and pour out like angry hornets. The task force trades room for room, each breach a choreography of flashbang, gunfire, and bone-deep trust.</p>
      <p>Falcon One’s overwatch is surgical: Iris paints targets, micro-UAVs lace flamers and stun rounds into choke points. Falcon Two threads a pair of stealth gunships through maintenance tunnels, their casings humming with electromagnetic whispers — they jam targeting arrays long enough to buy Raptor two precious minutes.</p>
      <p>The heavy dropship looms on the horizon, its mass a promise of brute force. Cain radios extraction: “Heavy in thirty. Warden, push point Bravo. We’re carrying a heat signature the size of a sun.” Doc answers: “We’ll buy you that window. LTV and two APCs cover the corridor. Keep it tight.”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>High Drama — Boarding and Counter-Boarding</h2>
      <p>With the containment cradle lashed, they stagger toward the extraction shaft. The heavy dropship rendezvous is a ballet of fire and strobe; orbital mercs — a privateer group called Iron Folly — have begun boarding from above, ejecting plasma grapnels and dropping troopers into hollows. The station’s bulkhead doors aren’t just closing — they’re becoming tactical barriers, carving the team into islands.</p>
      <p>In the shaft, a mercenary captain detonates a concussion — the blast throws Cain and two Raptor troopers into the shaft’s wall. One operative is down. The cradle slips audibly. Cain fights free, slams the containment back into his harness, and yells for the breach. Warden’s Doc rips through a maintenance panel and fires a line of adhesive charges. The hatch peels away in a shower of sparks, and the heavy dropship’s retroflares seize the moment. Gunships scream in and spray a molten arc that turns the corridor to a furnace. Falcons coordinate a micro-strike: six attack drones barrel into the mercs’ staging area, self-sacrificing to buy extraction time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Climax — The Cutter Is Threatened</h2>
      <p>They make the heavy dropship but the extraction is not clean. Iron Folly has a scavenged railgun; it finds the heavy dropship’s leading edge and scores a glancing hit. The dropship loses attitude control and slams into the cutter’s wake. The Aegis Spear answers with a cold, measured fury: its defensive grid commands the stealth gunships to form a shield and orders two of its stealth gunships to shepherd the heavy dropship away.</p>
      <p>The cradle is finally aboard the heavy dropship, lashed and humming. But Iron Folly isn’t finished — they’ve jammed comms and sent a boarding party fast-roping onto the Aegis Spear. Cain watches, breath ragged, as tracer lines stitch the cutter’s hull. The task force turns, reloads, and fights — now not only for the prototype, but to keep their ship from becoming a hostage.</p>
      <p>In the narrow of the cutter’s support bay, Raptor and Warden collide with boarding mercs in a pounding, up-close mayhem. Cain and Doc move like converging meteors. Iris lays down a precision volley that disables the boarding ship’s dock clamps. Gale releases a last-resort command: two attack drones feed into the boarding ramp and detonate, severing the mercs’ link and ejecting debris into vacuum. The heavy dropship, though battered, clears the cutter’s throat and ignites for home. The prototype is safe — for now.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Falling Action — Aftermath & Mystery</h2>
      <p>Back in the cutter’s medical hold, the task force watches the containment readouts. The lab tech, now conscious, whispers answers that don’t add up: the prototype was never meant to be exported; someone attempted to weaponize geography — a system that could alter orbital microclimates. “If it goes wrong,” she says, voice thin, “it could terraform a ring into a furnace.” Cain closes his eyes. The implications ripple out: nations, corporations, black markets.</p>
      <p>There’s a beat of triumph — the cradle hummed, intact — and then the subtle chill of possibility. Cain tucks the lab tech’s warning into the task force ledger. The Warden team begins cataloging casualties. Falcons reload and prepare for debrief. The cutter’s captain offers a single line over secure: “You saved the cutter. You saved more than that. Rest. Debrief in six hours.”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Epilogue — A Hook Left Burning</h2>
      <p>In the cutter’s dim transit corridor, Cain slips to the containment cradle and listens. The gelled core thrums a pattern — almost like a pulse. Doc warns them away. Cain smiles the smallest, tired smile a warrior can give and files the data: they did what they were paid to do. But when the clasped containment screen briefly flashes a map of Ring-9 — with a highlighted vector toward an unregistered locus — Cain’s jaw tightens.</p>
      <p>The mission log closes: Extraction nominal. Hostiles neutralized. Prototype secured. New vectors discovered. Mission debrief required. The Aegis Spear hums through black, carrying twelve soldiers, two stealth squadrons, one heavy dropship, and a secret that will make higher powers very, very interested. Fade out: the cutter disappears into the starfield. Behind it, a small ping: a corporate node has noticed an anomaly. A quiet elephant moves in the dark — and somewhere, a boardroom inhales, preparing its next move.</p>
